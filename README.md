# Data-Challenge :

Background:
The goal of this data challenge was to demonstrate my understanding of general machine
learning by predicting the price of airline tickets based on various features such as the date of
the journey, source, destination, route, departure time, arrival time, duration, total stops, and
additional information.

# Tasks:

● Task 1: Before training a regression model, it's essential to analyze, and preprocess the
data to ensure that it's suitable for analysis and modeling. This step involves handling
missing values, converting categorical variables into numerical representations, and
performing feature engineering to extract useful information from the existing features.

● Task 2: Develop the best regression model for predicting the price of airline tickets using
the provided training dataset.

● Task 3: Use the provided test dataset to generate predictions using your model.

# Dataset:
I was provided with a dataset containing information about airline tickets. You'll use train_data
and train_labels to train your model, where train_data contains features (like Airline,
Date_of_Journey, etc.) and train_labels contains corresponding target values (Price in this
case). You’ll use the trained model to predict a set of labels based on test_data. However, you
will not have access to the real test_labels.

# Dataset Features:

● Airline: The name of the airline.

● Date_of_Journey: The date of the journey.

● Source: The source of the flight.

● Destination: The destination of the flight.

● Route: The route of the flight.

● Dep_Time: The departure time.
● Arrival_Time: The arrival time.
● Total_Stops: The total number of stops during the flight.
● Additional_Info: Additional information about the flight.
● Normalized_Price: The normalized price of the airline ticket.
